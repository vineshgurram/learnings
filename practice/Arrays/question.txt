Basic 
1. Reverse an array without using reverse().
2. Find the maximum and minimum numbers in an array.
3. Sum all numbers in an array.
4. Remove duplicates from an array.
5. Check if an element exists in an array.
6. Count how many times an element appears in an array.
7. Merge two arrays into one.
8. Find the index of a given element in an array.
9. Sort numbers in ascending and descending order without using .sort() (logic-based).
10. Get only even numbers from an array. -pending

Intermediate 
11. Flatten a nested array
Example: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]] → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
12. Rotate an array by k positions (left or right).
13. Find the second largest number in an array.
14. Split an array into chunks.
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], chunkSize=2 → [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
15. Remove falsy values from an array (false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN).
16. Find common elements between two arrays.
17. Find elements present in the first array but not in the second.
18. Convert an array of strings to uppercase.
19. Create a function that shuffles an array randomly.
20 Group array elements by a property (useful for React data).

Tricky 
21. Given an array of numbers, return an array where each element is the product of all other elements (without using division).
22. Find all pairs in an array whose sum equals a given target.
23. Move all zeros to the end while keeping the order of other elements.
24. Find the longest consecutive sequence in an array.
25. Create a function that removes duplicates but keeps the last occurrence.
26. Count frequency of each number in an array and return as an object.
27. From an array of objects, extract all unique values from a given key.
28. Chunk an array into parts but preserve the order.
29. Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
30. From an array of numbers, find the subarray with the largest sum (Kadane's Algorithm).
